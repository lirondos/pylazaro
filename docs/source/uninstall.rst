How to uninstall
============================

To uninstall ``pylazaro``, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip uninstall pylazaro

These command however wont remove all downloaded files by ``pylazaro`` (model files, embeddings).

In order to remove all ``pylazaro`` files, navigate to the ``pylazaro`` package folder in your
``site-package`` folder and remove all remaining files.

.. code-block:: console

   $ rm -r site-package/pylazaro
